## Technical Context

AI Receptionist Blog is a bare bones website built in pure html and css and deployed to github pages. The development environment is macOS using the VS Code IDE. 

JS could be used if needed for responsiveness, but no JS would be preferred.

The color scheme, font and other styling should match that of https://ai-receptionist.com/

The file `static/robots.txt` should be used to encourage scraping from search engines.

The site will be hosted on github pages at https://blog.ai-receptionist.com.


The site will just be a running list of current blogs in chronological order with the newest blogs on top.

The blog previews in the list should contain a title, date, image and a paragraph or two with a link to the full page stand alone blog article.

URLs for the blog articles should be SEO aware, packed full of keywords. All HTML should be SEO optimized.

Use the image: `undraw_page-not-found_6wni.svg` for any 404 page not founds.


## TODO

1. In index.html, section:



        <section class="hero-section">
            <div class="hero-content">
                <h1>AI Receptionist Blog</h1>
                <p>Explore the cutting edge of AI-powered phone automation, customer experience trends, and business communication strategies from the team behind AI Receptionist.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="scroll-indicator"></div>
        </section>

I need a fixed carousel section underneath featuring a thumbnail of the article and a title for the latest 3 blog articles.
